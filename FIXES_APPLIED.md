### ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

#### 1. **CSS Not Loading (Critical)**
**Problem:** Website was displaying without any styling - completely unstyled HTML

**Root Cause:**
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/postcss` was not compiling properly
- The `@import "tailwindcss"` directive wasn't generating CSS
- CSS file was empty (only 5 lines)

**Solution:**
- Downgraded from Tailwind CSS v4 to v3.4.1 (stable version)
- Created proper `tailwind.config.js` for v3
- Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to use standard Tailwind
- Fixed CSS syntax issues:
  - Changed `@import "tailwindcss"` to `@tailwind` directives
  - Removed `@theme` block (v4 specific)
  - Fixed opacity syntax (`outline-ring/50` ‚Üí direct CSS)
  - Fixed `bg-background/80` ‚Üí `rgba()` syntax
  - Fixed `hover:shadow-primary/25` ‚Üí direct box-shadow

**Result:** ‚úÖ CSS now loading successfully (5022 lines generated)

#### 2. **Merge Conflicts Resolved**
**Problem:** Proto branch and main branch had divergent changes

**Solution:**
- Kept main branch's advanced authentication system
- Integrated Proto branch's enhanced dashboard and events
- Resolved all 10 file conflicts successfully

**Files Kept from Main:**
- Authentication components (AuthFlow, LoginForm, SignUpForm, OTP, ProfileCreation)
- AuthProvider with session management
