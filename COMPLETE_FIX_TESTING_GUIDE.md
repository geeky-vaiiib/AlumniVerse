# ✅ AlumniVerse - Complete Fix & Testing Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Issue Identified:**
- Users were confused about authentication method
- System uses **OTP-only** but showed password fields
- Error messages were misleading
- Users couldn't understand why login failed

### **Root Cause:**
- **SignUpForm** asked for password but never used it for authentication
- **LoginForm** showed password option but system only supports OTP

- No passwords are stored or verified

### **Solution Implemented:**
✅ Removed password fields from SignUpForm
✅ Made LoginForm OTP-only (removed password option)
✅ Improved error messages for clarity
✅ Added visual indicators about passwordless authentication
✅ Enhanced user guidance with info boxes
