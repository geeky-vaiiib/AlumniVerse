## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Password Creation During Signup
**Problem:** Signup only verified OTP without creating a password  
**Solution:** Added password and confirm password fields to SignUpForm

**Changes Made:**
- Added password and confirmPassword fields to form state
- Implemented password visibility toggle (Eye/EyeOff icons)
- Added comprehensive password validation:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase letter
  - Must contain lowercase letter
  - Must contain number
- Password confirmation matching validation
- Password is now passed through OTP verification to profile creation

**Files Modified:**
- `components/auth/SignUpForm.jsx`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Profile Completion with Resume & Social Links
**Problem:** After signup, users weren't prompted to fill resume, LeetCode, LinkedIn, and GitHub links  
**Solution:** Made all social links and resume REQUIRED in profile creation flow

**Changes Made:**
- Updated ProfileCreationFlow to require:
  - LinkedIn URL (validated format)
  - GitHub URL (validated format)
  - LeetCode URL (validated format)
  - Resume URL (required field)
- Added validation to ensure all fields are filled before proceeding
- Updated step description to indicate "Required"

**Files Modified:**
- `components/profile/ProfileCreationFlow.jsx`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Auto-Populate Extracted Email Data
**Problem:** Data extracted from SIT email wasn't reflected in profile  
**Solution:** Auto-populate profile form with extracted data from email parsing

**Changes Made:**
- ProfileCreationFlow now extracts data from `userData.userData`
- Auto-fills the following fields:
  - First Name (from email parsing)
  - Last Name (from email parsing)
  - Branch (from USN branch code)
  - Year of Passing (from USN)
  - USN (complete USN)
  - Joining Year (calculated from USN)
- Users don't need to re-enter information already extracted

**Files Modified:**
- `components/profile/ProfileCreationFlow.jsx`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Remove Static Data - Use Real User Data
**Problem:** Dashboard showed hardcoded "John Doe" data  
**Solution:** Integrated real user data from authentication context

**Changes Made:**
- DashboardSidebar now uses `useAuth()` hook
- Dynamically displays:
  - Real user name (from metadata or email)
  - User email
  - Batch/passing year
  - Branch
  - Current company
  - Designation
  - Location
  - Connections count
  - Profile completion percentage
  - LinkedIn, GitHub, LeetCode URLs
  - Resume URL
- Falls back to sensible defaults if data not available

**Files Modified:**
- `components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.jsx`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Auth Page Styling - Navbar & Background
**Problem:** Signup/login pages had no navbar and inconsistent background  
**Solution:** Added Navbar and consistent background across all auth pages

**Changes Made:**
- Added Navbar component to auth page
- Set consistent `bg-background` class
- Removed duplicate background classes from individual forms:
  - SignUpForm
  - LoginForm
  - OTPVerification
- All forms now use `bg-surface` and `border-border` for consistency
- Proper padding and centering maintained

**Files Modified:**
- `app/auth/page.jsx`
- `components/auth/SignUpForm.jsx`
- `components/auth/LoginForm.jsx`
- `components/auth/OTPVerification.jsx`
