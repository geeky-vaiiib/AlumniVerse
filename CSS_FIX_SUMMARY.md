# CSS Loading Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
The website is loading without any CSS styling because Tailwind CSS v4 is not compiling properly with the `@import "tailwindcss"` directive.

## Root Cause
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses a new compilation system with `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- The `@import "tailwindcss"` needs proper configuration
- CSS variables need to be registered with `@theme` directive

## Current Status
- HTML is rendering correctly with Tailwind class names
- CSS file is being referenced but contains no styles (empty/5 lines)
- Server is running on port 3000

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use inline styles temporarily
Add inline styles to critical components to make the site usable while fixing Tailwind

### Option 2: Add base CSS manually  
Create a comprehensive CSS file with all the necessary styles

### Option 3: Downgrade to Tailwind v3
Switch back to the stable Tailwind v3 which has proven compatibility

## Recommended: Option 3 - Downgrade to Tailwind v3
This is the most reliable solution for immediate results.
